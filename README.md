## Usage

> Some usage instructions

yarn
```

## Requirements

- Node 6.9.x
- Redis 3.2.x
- MongoDB *
- etc

## Development

### Installing System Dependencies

```
brew install yarn
brew install redis
brew install postgresql
```

Yarn is a replacement for npm. It's faster and *guarantees* consistency -- as you deploy your code in various environments, you won't run the risk of slight variations in what gets installed.

### Install Project Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## App Configuration

Override settings `config/default.json` in any environment by making a copy of `config/ENV.example.json` and naming it `config/ENV.json` and setting the appropriate variable. 

For environments that require use of environment variables, you can supply variables as defined in `config/custom-environment-variables.json`.

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/config
And https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Environment-Variables#custom-environment-variables

## Database Initialization

IMPORTANT: ensure `mongod` is running before performing these steps.
